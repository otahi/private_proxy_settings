* Private Proxy Settings

** Background
In some companies, http(s) clients need proxy servers
to access servers outside of a company .
In some cases, a proxy requires authentication with username/password pairs.
Some http(s) clients can not use proxy servers with authentications.

Furthermore, some users need to change the passwords in a specific period.
If users have several machines, users need to adjust the password
which stored in those machines.
